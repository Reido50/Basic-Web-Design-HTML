        <p>This website is dedicated to all that I have learned throughout the past semester in my online Web Design class.
        It will be used to showcase the various assignment and projects I have completed durring the class. I am very proud
        of the work I did and just want to show off my progress from the first few weeks up until the last. Click the right
        navigation arrow link in the top right corner of the screen to begin.<br>
        Feel free to browse through the different projects and, keep in mind, all of this was learned in one semester of class.
        Overall, I am glad I took Basic Web Design because I learned vast amounts about both HTML and CSS as well as discovering 
        what I like about programming.</p>
