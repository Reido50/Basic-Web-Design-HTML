        <p>     Hello! Welcome to my blog about life at Kingsford High School! It is (finally) graduation season and I have
                been getting pretty reminisent of my days spent at KHS. I thought it would be a great way to finish my four
                years here to present some advice to the upcoming freshman of next year because they seem to need all
                the help they can get. Without further ado, here is what I have to say to any frosh going to KHS this fall.

        <p>     You made it! Middle school is over and done with and your four years of high school are now beginning. 
                Now that I am graduating, I have a few words of advice you might want to know. In general terms, be humble,
                get involved, and stay motivated.
                
        </p>
        <p>     High school is not that much different than middle school. The main difference is the group of students 
                in your classrooms are going to be made up of people from potentially fours years of classes. Do not be 
                intimidated by the older kids. Most people hate the frosh by default, so you're going to have to deal with 
                some glares or snarky comments. Don't take it personal because frosh are the lowest on the totem pole, so 
                they are usually the punching bag for the whole high school. Just keep your head up and know that it gets 
                easier every year.

        <p>     Secondly, you need to get involved! I know it may be a generic term and you've probably heard it a million 
                different times, but it's because it is so important. If you want to be a student that rakes in the cash at 
                the end of your high school career in scholarships, you need to start getting busy early. If any sports seem 
                even remotely interesting, then try then out for goodness sake! You are a frosh with infinite possibilities 
                on what kind of student you would like to be. The same goes for clubs and extra-curricular activities. If it 
                was not your thing in middle school, then there is no reason it will be the same for high school. You have no 
                idea how much four years in a few sports or a few hundred volunteer hours will benefit you in the long run. 
                Colleges and scholarship givers love to see the previously mentioned activities on your application. As a 
                benefit, being involved will also transfer into your academic life. The added responsibilities help you 
                immensely with becoming mature and gaining the ability to get work done without procrastinating (at least not 
                too much.)

        <p>     Lastly, stay academically driven. The brutally honest truth is your middle school grades mean absolutely 
                nothing. No colleges, scholarships, or awards look at middle school grades. This makes freshman year of high 
                school a perfect place to start a habit of trying your very hardest to achieve a report card full of letters 
                near the front of the alphabet. Giving your 100% effort toward school earns you more respect from your peers 
                and teachers, more college options, and more scholarship money. The college and scholarship portion is not an 
                instant gratification. These are usually waited on until the tail end of junior year and the entirety of 
                senior year, but, let me tell you, it pays off big time. I received $17,000 on the night of the scholarship 
                banquet and had offers of full-tuition cost to multiple schools all just from seeking success in my academic 
                life. You have all the pieces; you just need to put them together and freshman year of high school is the 
                start. Let nothing stand in your way of your goals and don't forget to have a good time pursuing them.
