		These cold temperatures and dangerous conditions have not been exclusive to the Dickinson County Area, however. The entire
		midwest region of the United States has been experiencing a deep freeze caused by what meteorologists are calling a 
		<q>Polar Vortex</q>. This system is characterized by low pressure and swirling cold air in polar regions. It is common for
		this type of system to move down southward to the midwestern and northwest United States, which is what has been happening
		in the past few weeks.
