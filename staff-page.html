        <p style="font-size:20px;">Reido</p>
        <p>Reido is the founder of Guard Squad Inc. It is called Guard Squad Inc because everybody in the squad is a
            "guard" in some way, shape, or form. Reid was a left guard on the varsity football team. He is an avid disc golf
            with a passion for computers. He will be attendning Michigan State University in the Fall for a degree in
            computer science and plans to go into the video game industry.

        <p style="font-size:20px;">Poundo</p>
        <p>Poundo is the backbone of Guard Squad Inc. He always shows up to every meeting on time and is just a good guy.
            He played right guard on the varsity football team. Poundo got his infamous nickname from way back in little league
            baseball when he would pound the bat on home plate several times before swinging. He will also be going to MSU in 
            the fall and will be rooming with Reido. Poundo is going to major is supply chain management.

        <p style="font-size:20px;">Banger</p>
        <p>Banger is the gooniest member of Guard Squad Inc. He's somewhat inconsistant, but is still a valued member of the squad.
            He loves hockey, but became a part of Guard Squad Inc by being a backup/scout guard on the varsity football team.
            Banger only loves one thing more than Mountain Dew and that is his dream of becoming a dentist. He is going to 
            Central Michigan University to join the dentistry program.

        <p style="font-size:20px;">Beau</p>
        <p>Beau is the most recently added member of Guard Squad Inc. He was considered for application to the squad when he 
            joined Reido, Poundo, and Banger for wings one Monday. Poundo and Beau often call each other 
            strange compound names like "Cheese-ball" or "Beard-guy." It is a mystery where they come up with these psuedonyms, 
            but they are quite goony. Beau was a point-guard on the varsity basketball team and plans to contuniue playing at 
            Bay College.
